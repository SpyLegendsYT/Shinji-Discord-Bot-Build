# Shinji-Discord-Bot-Build
This is a build of a discord bot I did a while back. There are certainly some problems, but for the most part it functions well. This can serve as an example discord bot for anyone interested in creating one by themselves. I've tried to leave comments in there in order to help you out. The features that are currently functioning in this bot include: 
-A ban system
-A ban system that creates a poll in which people vote with using prompted reactions
-A kick system
-A minecraft server, <If you understand the address of the server you can see the population in a server. For example for Hypixel, you would type :mc hypixel.net 25565>
-A system that will give you an invite link (Insignificant)
-A system that will send you a Message Embed with the information about the bot.
-A system that clears messages from a server

This bot is not usually onine, so if you do choose to invite this bot to your server, be wary it may not be online.
